# qwik-router

A SPA-like router for Qwik.

## Why?

Many Qwik native solutions, like routing, are very attached to Qwik City, which is great for most use cases. But sometimes, a file-based routing is not enough.

Possible use cases are:

- Micro-frontends with Qwik, where you need to load different apps in the same page
- When you need a component-based routing with customized rules.
- When you meed multiple routers in the same page.

Thinking of that, I created this router to be used with Qwik, based on similar projects like vue-router and react-router.

This follows Qwik principles and is targeed for flexibility. If you don't have very unique routing needs, you should use Qwik City.
