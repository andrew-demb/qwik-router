# qwik-router

A SPA-like router for Qwik.

## Why?

Many Qwik native solutions, like routing, are very attached to Qwik City, which is great for most use cases. But sometimes, more than a file-based routing is needed.

Possible use cases are:

- Micro-frontends with Qwik, where you need to load different apps on the same page
- When you need a component-based routing with customized rules.
- When you need multiple routers on the same page.

Thinking of that, I created this router to be used with Qwik based on similar projects like vue-router and react-router.

This follows Qwik principles and is targeted for flexibility. If you don't have unique routing needs, you should use Qwik City.

This component has been used in production in a few projects but is still in beta.

I'll add more documentation and examples in the next few days.
